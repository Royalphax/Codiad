### This fork is absolutly not official and my only goal is to allow the great Codiad web IDE to work on my PHP 8 instance. I know there are other alternatives with more security, functionality, etc. But codiad already fits my needs and works great, so why change ? This repo is for anyone looking for a PHP 8.0 compatible version of codiad. If you encounter any errors or problems, please fix it by yourself and make a pull request (I will accept them).

# Codiad Web IDE

Codiad is a web-based IDE framework with a small footprint and minimal requirements. 

Codiad was built with simplicity in mind, allowing for fast, interactive development without the massive overhead of some of the larger desktop editors. That being said even users of IDE's such as Eclipse, NetBeans and Aptana are finding Codiad's simplicity to be a huge benefit. While simplicity was key, we didn't skimp on features and have a team of dedicated developer actively adding more.

For more information on the project please check out the **[check out the Wiki](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/wiki)** or **[the Codiad Website](http://www.codiad.com)**

## Unmaintained Status

You may use the [issues](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/issues) for seeking community help on any ongoing issues, however, the code maintained in this repository is unlikely to be updated.
